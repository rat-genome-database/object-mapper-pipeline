  improved logging

Oct 03, 2019
  renamed sslpMapper to markerMapper

Jan 17, 2019 -- ver 2.0.4
  refactored build.gradle; improved logging

Sep 17, 2018 -- ver 2.0.3
  moved from subversion to github

Feb 19, 2018 -- ver 2.0.2
  upgraded code to java 8; streamlined logging

Jan 27, 2017 -- ver 2.0.1
  QTLMapper: separated generation of out-of-region genes to standalone script

Dec 21, 2016 -- ver 2.0
  updated to use GRADLE instead of ANT

Sep 20, 2016 -- ver 1.2.12
  StrainMapper: extended mapping of mutant strains to strain types 'mutant_knockin','mutant_knockout'

Jan 27, 2016 -- ver 1.2.11
  SslpMapper: tuned up logging

Jan 27, 2016 -- ver 1.2.10
  SslpMapper: new mapper for DB_SNP rat SSLPs
  QtlMapper: simplified code
  StrainMapper: simplified code

May 21, 2015 -- ver 1.2.9
  QtlMapper: improved reporting of unpositionable qtls, esp. for mouse

Apr 27, 2015 -- ver 1.2.8
  Strain Mapper v.1.2.1: allows positioning of mutant strains

Apr 24, 2015 -- ver 1.2.7
  Strain Mapper v.1.2.0: allows handling of multiple regions (for double/triple congenic strains)

Dec 08, 2014 -- ver 1.2.6
  QTL + Strain Mapper: uses the exact chromosome sizes for the purpose of positioning strains and qtls
    (previously the chromosome size was estimated as the largest stop_pos of genes on the given chromosome)

Sep 24, 2014 -- ver 1.2.5
  QTL + Strain Mapper: changed src pipeline to 'RGD_MAPPER_PIPELINE' per communication with Rajni and Jennifer

Sep 5, 2014 -- ver 1.2.4
  QTL + Strain Mapper: added support for Rnor_6.0

Feb 4, 2014 -- ver 1.2.3
  QTL Mapper v. 1.2:
  - improved QC (for flanking markers with START_POS=0, STOP_POS=0 positions)
  - improved logging (not relevant information is no longer logged, to improve log readability)

Aug 2, 2013 -- ver 1.2.2
  QTL Mapper v. 1.1:
  - qtl position changes logged to separate file position_changes.log
      and then emailed to interested parties;
  - qtls could be positioned on consensus chromosome: if there are multiple markers having positions
      on multiple chromosomes, the chromosome that is most frequent is chosen as consensus chromosome
      and marker positions on this consensus chr are used to position the qtl

Jan 22, 2013 -- ver 1.2.1
  Fixed the confusing messages when processing qtls with obsolete positions.

Dec 7, 2012 -- ver 1.2
  Migrated QtlMapper from ftpFileExtracts; QTL mapper is setup to update data also for new assemblies for mouse and rat

Nov 20, 2012 -- ver 1.1
  StrainMapper module extended to compute strain positions on rat assembly maps 5.0 (map_key=70)
